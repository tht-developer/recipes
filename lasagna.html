    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
        This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>

    <h3>Grandma's special recipe, passed down for generations!</h3>

    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to 
        bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>

        <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has 
        en cooking since his college days.

    <p>Chicken Parmesan is a classic for a reason! Chicken cutlets, breaded and fried, 
        smothered with tomato sauce, and covered with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses are so good. 
        Serve with pasta or on a roll.</p>

    <h3>Grandma's special recipe, passed down for generations!</h3>

    <p>Oh, how we love chicken parmesanâ€”chicken cutlets, breaded and fried, smothered with tomato sauce, 
        covered with mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses, and baked until the cheese is bubbly and melts into every nook and cranny.</p>

        <p>It's one of those everyone-should-know-how-to-make recipes. It's easy and comes together quickly. In fact, it's hard to
             mess up! Chicken Parmesan is also one of the best uses I can think of for boneless, skinless, chicken breasts.</p>

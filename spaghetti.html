    <h3>Grandma's special recipe, passed down for generations!</h3>

    <p>Mounds of spaghetti, fork twirling strands in a spoon, tasty meatballs, even the very serving of the spaghetti, trying 
        to lift just the right amount from the bowl â€” these are some of my favorite memories from childhood.</p>
<div class="top-section">
        This particular spaghetti and meatballs recipe was given to us by Rick Mindermann of our local Italian grocery store Corti Brothers.
             Rick is one of these walking encyclopedias of food knowledge, whose enthusiasm for all things food and cooking is infectious.
